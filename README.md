If you use this method your departureCard will always update to the newest version.

# Have fun!

## Card Configuration

The following example demonstrates how to configure the card in your dashboard. You can use the graphical editor or the following yaml configuration.

```yaml
type: custom:departure-card
title: Köln Hbf
entity: sensor.koln_hbf_departures
connections_attribute: next_departures
displayed_connections: 8
unix_time: false
convertTimeHHMM: false
relativeTime: false
targets: null
train: train
platform: platform
show_platform: true
departure: scheduledDeparture
delay: delayDeparture
isCancelled: isCancelled 
stopAttribute: route 
filterByStop: Köln Messe/Deutz
stationName: Köln Hbf
```
## Filter Options
There are multiple ways you can filter and display connections. 

### 1. Filter by target
If you want to see all connections with a specific final destination, you can filter your connections by target. 
This example shows all trains and busses with destination "Düsseldorf Hbf": 
```yaml
targets: Düsseldorf Hbf
```

If you want disable this filter and see all connections just set it to "null" or skip this line.

### 2. Filter by stop
If you want to show only connections which have a certain stop, you have to make sure this information is provided by the api. Not for all stations those information are given.

You can check your entity with the template tool in the developer section of your home assistant.
```yaml
{{ states.sensor.YOUR_ENTITY.attributes }}
```
Usually there should be an route[] item which contains a list of stops. You can use the stopAttribute if the list of stops are not displayed under route or if the name of the element is different. If it's route you can skip this line. 

Since the list of stops contains all stops of the train, we need to know which stops are allready done and which stops are still to go. Therefor you have to provide the information of your stationName.
```yaml
stationName: Köln Hbf
```
All stops before Köln Hbf will be ignored in the list of stops because those are not in the direction of travel. 

Now you have to provide the name of the stop which you want to filter all remaining connections by. 
```yaml
filterByStop: Köln Messe/Deutz
```
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BagelBeef/ha-departureCard/refs/heads/main/images/filterByStop.jpg" alt="Preview3" width="400px">

You can skip those lines to disable this filter.
